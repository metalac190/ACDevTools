1. Create a new class that inherits from GenericObjectPool
	- This will be the Pooler class that keeps track of the pool objects
	Ex. public class ShotPool : GenericObjectPool<BlasterShot> 
	{ 
	}

2. Add this Pooler class to a GameObject. This GameObject will now be in charge of the pool

3. Specify a prefab for this Pool class to pool
	- This prefab must have a component of the Type specified in the Pooler Class

4. Wherever you want -> Access Pooler class and get/return objects as needed!

/// In order to implement this StateMachine, you need to do the following things:
/// 1. Create some sort of Controller that inherits from StateMachine
/// 2. Create a few classes that inherit from State
/// 3. Implement the required functions in the new State class
/// 4. Create a few instances of the class somewhere in your new Controller
/// 5. Use ChangeState(state) to Change to any of the states in your Controller!
/// 6. If the States need more information, you can pass them down in the Constructor when the Controller initializes them
